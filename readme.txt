*Key Features ::*

*Like/Dislike Functionality:* Users can express their opinions about posts or products with a simple click. This binary system allows for quick interaction.

*Ratings System:* Beyond like/dislike, users can leave a more nuanced rating, typically on a scale (e.g., 1 to 5 stars). This gives a clearer picture of user sentiment.

*User Feedback Loop:* The plugin should display the number of likes, dislikes, and the average rating to all viewers, providing immediate feedback on the community's reception of a post or product.

*Anti-Spam Measures*: To ensure the integrity of the feedback, the system should include features to prevent spam and manipulation, such as limiting votes per IP or requiring user registration.

*Customization Options:* Website owners should be able to customize the appearance of like/dislike buttons and the rating system to match their site's design. Additionally, there should be options to choose where these buttons appear (e.g., before the content, after, or both).
